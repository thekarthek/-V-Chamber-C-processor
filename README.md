# -V-Chamber-C-processor
Designed a hybrid thermodynamic–ML framework integrating a 3 mm phase-change vapor chamber with predictive analytics to enhance compact processor thermal stability. Applied transient heat transfer modeling and LSTM forecasting to anticipate thermal spikes, enabling proactive control that reduced throttling and improved sustained performance.
